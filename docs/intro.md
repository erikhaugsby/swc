## How to install the YouTube app

This page gives you step-by-step instructions for how to install the official YouTube app on your Apple or Android smartphone.

The YouTube app is free to download and use. You only need to have your phone and access to the internet. 

Before you do anything else, read through all of these steps in order. It might help to have this page open on another device as a reference.

    === "Android"
  
        1. Tap the "Home" button, which is the circle in the bottom-middle of the screen. 
        2. Swipe up from the bottom of the display. The "App Drawer" screen appears (see the screenshot below).
        3. Tap the search field.
        4. Type **YouTube**.
        5. If the YouTube app appears in the search results, the app is already installed and you can click on the icon to start using it.
